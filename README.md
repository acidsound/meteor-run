# meteor-run
Run game with meteor for Meteor 2015 Global distributed Hackathon

## Inspiration
Don't Tap white tile.

## What it does
Tap White Tile 

## How we built it
We decided with Meteor's reactiveness, we could re-create the famous mobile game Don't Tap White Tile, 
but with a little bit of twist by adding Multiplayer Features.

## Challenges we ran into
Optimizing performance on as many devices and browsers possible.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
WebAudio. No loading. Fast!

## What we learned
Meteor is great for creating browser based games! And WebAudio.

## What's next for meteor-run
We will add more animations and transitions, features and layout for the best experience. And ofcourse, performance optimization.
